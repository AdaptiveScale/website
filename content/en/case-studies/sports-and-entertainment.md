### Scenario

The customer, a Sports and Entertainment company has arriving in XML files and the data scientists 
couldn't query for the information they needed. They weren't sure what the final format would be for 
the tables and needed to be able to adjust quickly. They required access to the final data from their 
existing BI tools such as Tableau and R.

### CDAP value proposition(s)

CDAP enables customers to ingest and transform the XML data into multiple tables without writing any code.

The ability to copy and adjust pipelines allows them to quickly make changes as needed by their data team. 

Every new report or data source ingestion from Netezza took months to generate.

CDAP’s ODBC and JDBC drivers allow users to access data from the tools they are comfortable using.
