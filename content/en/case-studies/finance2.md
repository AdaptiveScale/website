### Scenario

The customer, a Fortune 500 company in the Financial sector, had custom-built a data pipeline to perform 
data validation and correction transforms. The pipeline was constructed using multiple complex technologies. 
Examples performed on the 3 billion records included:

* Standardization, verification, and cleansing of USPS codes  
* Domain set validation, Null Checks, Length Checks
* Regular expression validation (email, SSN, dates, etc.)

The legacy pipeline ran overnight, required multiple teams to keep it operating, and costly experts to maintain
it. For these basic mapping, transformations and validation tasks, they would like a visual tool to avoid 
ad-hoc coding and solutions.

### CDAP value proposition(s)

In-house Java programmers developed, tested, and ran the replacement pipeline using the drag-and-drop visual interface.

The new pipeline only required limited coding in order to integrate custom regular expressions.
